								<h2>Riptide</h2>
								<p>Riptide is a spaceship combat game with an emphasis on powerful customizations and utility. Accomplish your mission by loading up and taking out the enemy.</p>
								<p>On Riptide I worked heavily on initially creating the ship movement, however I progressed from ship movement onto a objective and narrative system. This system is meant to set up level objectives per level, allowing for elimination missions, survival missions, and spawning enemies at spawn points. This was combined with a custom build narrative system to allow dialogue to play throughout the missions.</p>
								<p>Furthermore I was also the Lead Programmer on the game, which I helped delagate work to all the programmers including myself, and I was the team member communicating to other leads to help define the project and to communicate programming needs to other diciplines.</p>
								<h2>Retro</h2>
								<p>I overall liked all of the work I did on this project. Becoming a lead for the team was a big step for me which I believed I could do and also was not entirely ready to do. I learned that for a while I lacked clarity in instructions that I gave. I did get to improve this however it proved difficult early on. I also believe that my narrative system could have been a lot better. Current state is very messy, both requiring a lot of reuse of the same nodes in unreal and being generally very clunky to work with as it was in the level blueprint itself rather than its own narrative blueprint for the level. If I could do this again I would consolidate narrative into its own blueprint that is present in the level as well as using a struct to hold all the variables needed for narration and just loop through an array of said struct to get to go through the dialogue.</p>
